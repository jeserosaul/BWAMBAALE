         <p align="center"><strong> What UCC supports children in Uganda?</strong> </p>
         <p>
         Since 2005, JOY FOR CHILDREN UGANDA has been championing the rights of all children to live peacefully & without exploitation, to benefit from quality free education, to thrive in economic security & justice, and to prosper with access to clean water, good health care, & nutrition.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong><u></u>What is daycare explained?</strong></p> 
        <p>
         CHILD CARE CENTERS: A Child Care Center (or Day Care Center) is usually located in a commercial building. Non-medical care and supervision is provided for infant to school age children in a group setting for periods of less than 24 hours.</p>
         <p>Not everyone has the chance to grow up in a safe environment.
UCC is providing a place of hope, love, care, safety, education, healing and gives hope for a new and better future perspective.
To ensure this, the Ugandan and German Team is working hand in hand together.
Together we can make a change , this is why the international cooperation
is a base for our success.</p>
<p>
    "We are convinced that all young people are valuable and loved - regardless of their background, health or social status. They should know about their worth. It is important to us that the young people experience this with us."
